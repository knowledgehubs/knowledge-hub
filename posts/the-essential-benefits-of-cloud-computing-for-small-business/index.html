There are only people who pushed through the awkward phase.\nKey Challenges Context switching between learning and current job drains energy. After full workday, finding mental bandwidth for technical learning is genuinely difficult. Cognitive fatigue makes evening learning less effective than dedicated time. Maintaining consistency when exhausted tests discipline repeatedly.\nExpert Tips And Insights Set up snippets for code you write repeatedly: Your editor can expand shortcuts into full code blocks. Create snippets for HTML boilerplate, function templates, import statements. This efficiency gain compounds over time and reduces repetitive typing. Customize your environment for your workflow.\nBenefits And Advantages Algorithmic thinking improves efficiency consciousness. Understanding time complexity and optimization makes you aware of inefficiency everywhere. You naturally seek better approaches to repetitive tasks, saving time across all activities.\nPractical Steps To Implement Handling rejection during job search (5 coping strategies): Expect rejection as normal—even strong candidates get rejected frequently. Request feedback when possible and improve based on patterns. Treat each interview as practice making you better for next one. Maintain multiple applications in pipeline so single rejection doesn’t derail momentum. Process disappointment briefly then move forward—dwelling doesn’t help.
